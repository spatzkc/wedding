<h1>Growing up...</h1>
<p>
Emily grew up in Maumelle, Arkansas with her parents, Dan and Melodi, and siblings, Amanda and Logan.
 She has always loved reading, drawing, animals (especially dogs), and spending time in the great outdoors.
  At North Little Rock High School, Emily spent her time in band, color guard, theater, and science clubs. 
She went to Hendrix College and decided to pursue a Biochemistry degree with the goal of becoming a pharmacist.
 There she explored studio art, chemistry research, and cooking.

Although they grew up a mere 20 miles apart and shared many activities and interests, Kevin and Emily never met or heard of each other until Kevin was a senior in college!
</p>


<h1>How it all started...</h1>
<p>
As you may have guessed, they met at Hendrix College while they were students.
 Emily saw Kevin perform in a play and developed a little crush on him, but they didn’t become friends until almost two years later.
  After striking up conversation at a friend’s birthday party, Kevin became interested. He asked for Emily’s phone number the next time they saw each other and they began spending time together. 
</p>
<p>
After several months, Kevin told Emily he wanted to date. Some of their early dates included swimming at the Hendrix pool, stargazing at the river on Halloween, and cooking fancy dinners together.
 Kevin taught Emily how to dive and she showed him her favorite old movies.
  These first dates went so well that Emily asked him to be her boyfriend not long after!

<h1>How he proposed...</h1>
<p>
	After being an official couple for a few years, Kevin began planning a surprise proposal. He chose the botanical garden in Hot Springs they visited on their first anniversary as the scene.
	 But the romance didn’t stop there! He arranged to have a friend hide in the bushes so that the special moment could be caught on camera.
	  He also planned a surprise engagement party in downtown Hot Springs with their immediate families.
</p>
<p>	
	However, things don’t always go as planned! The day of the proposal, it was just starting to rain as they arrived at the garden.
	 Kevin had to talk Emily into going in, even though everyone was hurrying out of the park.
	  He finally convinced her that it would be “romantic” to go for a walk in the rain.
	   He dragged her in the door, but to her surprise it was actually romantic and peaceful to explore the park in the drizzle.
	    Emily said she felt like they were “the only two people for miles.” 
</p>
<p>	
	When they reached Emily’s favorite overlook, Kevin asked her to walk out onto the trail with him.
	 She followed and just as they crossed the creek, Kevin told her he wanted to be with her for all their lives and dropped to one knee!
	He put the ring on her finger as she said an emotional and enthusiastic yes!
</p>


<h1>Headed to the alter!</h1>
<p>
Now Emily and Kevin live in Little Rock with their dogs, Karma and Phantom, and their bearded dragon, Toothless.
 Emily is going to school at UAMS College of Pharmacy and Kevin is working on building a career in computer programming. They are excited to begin married life!
